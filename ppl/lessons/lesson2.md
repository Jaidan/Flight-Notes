Pretakeoff
----------

RPM drop > 100 on Left magneto.  Likely a fouled spark plug

### Steps to clear

1. Lean approx 1 in.
2. Increase RPM to 2200
3. Continue checklist
4. Reduce power to 1700/full rich
5. Test magneto for <100 rpm drop

Slow Flight
-----------

Clear Area
Reduce power to 1500
Carb heat on
Increase pitch to slow down while maintaining altitude
After white arc drop flaps, adjust pitch to matain level flight
Increase power to 1900-2000 rpm, adjust pitch an power as necessary to maintain level flight ~55-60 kts

Slow Flight Recovery
--------------------

Throttle Full, maintain level flight
Flaps 20, carb heat off
Establish normal climb at Vx (55kts)
Positive Climb, Flaps 10
Vy (67kts) Flaps up
Level off and establish normal cruise

Power Off Stall
---------------

Clear area
Reduce power to 1500
Carb heat on
Increase pitch to slow down while maintaining altitude
After white arc drop flaps, adjust pitch to maintain level flight
Capture 60kts and reduce throttle to idle
Pitch down to maintain 60kts
Gradually increase pitch until stall
Release back pressure, allow nose to fall below horizon
Full power, carb heat off, flaps up, pitch for positive climb rate

Power On Stall
--------------

Clear area
Reduce power to 1500
Carb heat on
Increase pitch to slow down while maintaining altitude
Increase power to 2200 rpm, carb heat off
Increase pitch above normal climb
Wait for stall
Decrease back pressure allow nose to fall to horizon
Level wings increase pitch to establish climb

Steep Turns
-----------

Maintain coordinated flight
Bank to ~45
Pitch up to maintain altitude (put a bolt on the horizon)
Begin roll out ahead of final heading, reduce back pressure during roll out

Turns about a Point
--------------------

Start downwind
Use Increased bank angle on the frst crosswind section,
decreased bank angle on the upwind section and second crosswind section
Maintain sight picture on target to maintain distance

S Turns
-------

Similar to turns about a point except are done in a sequence of left and right turns about a stright line.
Correction theory is the same:
Use less bank when the wind will blow you toward the line, more bank when the wind will blow you away from the line, and complete turns pointing upwind to maintain a straight ground track.

Notes
-----

Strange indication on the altimeter during slow flight.  A gust into the static tube caused fluctuations on the altimeter reading
