Procedure Notes
---------------

### Starting

Mixture rich before fuel pump on contrary to Cessna procedures.
Oil pressure to minimum green arc within 30seconds
Do not run up when oil temp below 75 (off of white dot)

### Before Taxi

Switch fuel tanks to ensure operation (seems like a good idea to do this on the Cherokee as well)
Avoid Battery depletion by running at higher RPM's if low voltage is indicated

### Before takeoff

Max 175 RPM drop max 50 differential
Cycle prop three times

### Takeoff

Operate engine controls smoothly particularly the throttle due to the use of a counterweighted crankshaft

### Cruise climb

26" 2600 RPM

### Best rate/angle climb

Full throttle 2700 RPM
Lean for best power
Vy: 86 KIAS up to 10,000 then 80 KIAS
Vx: 66 KIAS + 1.0KIAS per 5000 feet
