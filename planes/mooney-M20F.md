Procedure Notes
---------------

### Starting

Mixture rich before fuel pump on contrary to Cessna procedures.
Oil pressure to minimum green arc within 30seconds
Do not run up when oil temp below 75 

### Before Taxi

Switch fuel tanks to ensure operation (seems like a good idea to do this on the Cherokee as well)
Avoid Battery depletion by running at higher RPM's if low voltage is indicated

### Before takeoff

1700 RPM
Max 125 RPM drop max 50 differential
Cycle prop three times

### Takeoff

Operate engine controls smoothly particularly the throttle due to the use of a counterweighted crankshaft

### Cruise climb

26" 2600 RPM
115-120 MPH IAS

### Best rate/angle climb

Full throttle 2700 RPM
Lean for best power
Vy: 113 - 1 MPH IAS per 1k feet up to 10,000 then 102 
Vx: 94  

### Cruise

#### Powerboost operation
Allow direct unfiltered air into the engine (ram air).  Increased MP when operating at full throttle.

### Descent

Avoid operations between 1500 and 1950 RPM while below 15" MP.  
Avoid long high speed descents at lot MP to avoid excessive cooling
