Weight And Balance
------------------
Datum; an imaginary line from which locations in an aircraft are measured.

Arm; the horiztonal distance from the datum.  Aft is positive

Weight X Arm = Moment

Total Moment / Total Weight = CG inches aft of datum.

* _Empty Weight_ is the airframe, engine, fixed equipment, unusable fuel, and unusable oil \(some airplanes it's all of the oil\).
* _Useful load_ includes the pilot, passengers, baggage, fuel, and oil.
* _Takeoff weight_ is the empty weight + useful load
* _Landing weight_ is the takeoff weight minus any fuel used

### Standard weights
* GA crew or passenger _190 lbs_
* Gasoline _6 lbs/gal_
* Oil _7.5 lbs/gal_
* Water _8.35 lbs/gal_
