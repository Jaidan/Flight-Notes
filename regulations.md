91 Air Traffic and General Operating Rules
==========================================
PIC is the final authority as to the operation of the aircraft.  May violate regs in an emergency.  FAA may request a written report. When addressing a tower "Unable" is the keyword.

PIC is responsible for the airplanes airworthiness.  Owner or operator is responbile for maintaining the aircraft in an airworthy condition and ensuring that AD's are complied with.  It is the PIC's repsonsibility to ensure the owner or operator has performed that duty.

All Certified planes must have an approved flight manual

Preflight
---------
8 Hours Bottle to Throttle. .04% is the limit.  Must submit to breathalyzer or blood test

Preflight requement to be familiar with all information concerning the flight.  "I didn't know" isn't a valid excuse.

### Required information:

* Runway lengths
* Takeoff and landing performance under expected conditions
* Must have alternative plan of action
* Know the fuel requirements for the flight
* Weather reports and forecasts
* NOTAMs

Safety Belts
------------
Must be used by everyone for taxi, takeoff, and landing.  Shoulder harnesses \(if available\) must be used by crewmembers during takeoff and landing.


Right of way rules
------------------
### Order of resolution
* Aircraft in distress
* Balloons
* Aircraft towing another aircraft
* Gliders
* Airships
* Airplanes
* Rotorcraft

### Convegence of the same category

The aircraft on the right has the right of way.  A pilot seeing a red light \(left wing \) must pass behind the other airplane.  A pilot seeing a gree light \(right wing\) maintains course

When overtaking, give way to the right.
WHen head on, both pilots must give way to the right.
When approaching to land the airplane that is lower has the right of way.

Speed Limits
------------
No Speed limit >10k feet MSL
< 10k feet generally 250kts
In surface area below Bravo, in a VFR corridor, or in Bravo speed limit is 200kts.
Within 4nm of the primary airport in Charlie or Delta 200kts

Minimum Safe Altitudes
----------------------
Must always fly high enough to make a safe emergency landing.

Over congested areas must fly 1000 feet above highest obstacle and 2000 feet horizontally

Over other than congested areas must fly at least 500 feet above the surface and 500 feet horizontally from any person vessel, vehicle, or structure.

Roads and freeways are bad emergency landing strips.  You can't see obstacles until you are too low to change your mind

ATC Procedures
--------------
If you are given priority the Chief of the ATC facility may request you make a written report within 48 hours.
