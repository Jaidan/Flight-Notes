Wind, heating and Coriolis
--------------------------
Uneven heating causes warm air to rise an cold air to descend.  This causes circulation of air.  This is disturbed by the Coriolis force \(caused by earth's rotation\).  High pressure tries to flow into low pressure.  Coriolis causes it to deflect to the right and flow parallell to the isobars \(iso=same bars=pressure, lines of equal pressure\)

Circulation
-----------
Air circulates clockwise around a high
Air circulates counterclockwise around a low
Closer isboars = more wind
Up to 2000 AGL surface winds move outward from the senter of the high toward lower pressure
Winds move from high pressure to low pressure, modified by coriolis

Valley breeze, caused by forests cooling air high pressure 

Katabatic winds caused by night time rapid mountain cooling

Lenticular clouds signal very dangerous
Warm downslope winds are very dangerous


Temperature & Moisture Pressure
-------------------------------
Standard temp = 15C at sea level \(59F\)
Standard pressure = 29.92in/hg
-2C per 1000F \(3.5F\)

Temperature increase with altitude is known as an inversion

Terrestrial radiation causes a temperature inversion on clear still nights
The ground cools more rapidly than than air at great heights during night time.  The coldest air lies at the ground and is overlaid by warmer air.  This occurs between 90m and 300m

Temperature controls how much water vapor air can hold.  Warm air can hold more than cold.  Dew point is the temperature the air must be cool to to saturate with the moisture already present.

If relative humidity approaches 100% water will condense or sublimate.  If below freezing this causes dew, fog, and clouds.

Air masses
----------

Air takes on the properties of the land under it.  Causing it take on it's temperature and moisture characteristics

Ridges are elongated regions of high pressure.  Trough is low.  Fronts are troughs

Warm fronts move slower than cold fronts.

Dew point and temperature converge roughly 4.4F per 1000ft

Wind Shear
----------
Expect wind shear during temperature inversion, all sides of a thunderstorm \(including below\), and near fronts.  

Warm fronts wind shear is before the front passes \(6 hours\) and is worse than in cold fronts

Cold fronts wind shear is behind the front \(3 hours\).  

Ice
---
Super cool droplets fomr 0 - -15C

Fog
---
Fog forms when temp dewpoint spread is < 5C

### Radiation Fog
Formed by the ground cooling air in contact with it. Forms in warm, moist air over low, flatlands and clear calm nights.

### Advection Fog
Formed when warm, moist air moves over colder ground or water.o

### Upslope Fog
Moist stable air is blown up a slope.  Cools at 3C per 1000ft

### Precipitation Fog
Evaporation from rain saturates the low level air and forms fog


### Steam fog
Forms in winter when cold dry air passes over ocean waters
